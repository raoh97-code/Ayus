It combines the spaciousness of Serene Minimalism with subtle Ayurvedic motifs and a natural color palette. The layout is clean and balanced, promoting clarity and ease of use. The overall aesthetic is professional, trustworthy, and subtly luxurious.\n\nExecution Blueprint:\n1. **Symmetrical Balance:** The layout will adhere to a strict symmetrical structure, creating a sense of order and stability.\n2. **Whitespace as a Design Element:** Generous whitespace will be used to separate elements and create a feeling of spaciousness and calm.\n3. **Typographic Hierarchy:** A classic serif font (Cormorant Garamond) will be used for headings to convey elegance, paired with a clean sans-serif font (Sora) for body text to ensure readability.\n4. **Earthy Color Palette:** A muted color palette of greens, browns, and creams will be used to evoke a sense of nature and tranquility. A subtle gold accent will be used for key interactive elements.\n5. **Subtle Ayurvedic Motifs:** Incorporate simple line-art illustrations of Ayurvedic herbs or symbols as subtle decorative elements.",

The layout is modular and grid-based, balancing generous white space with blocks of earthy and soft accent colors. Typography is clean and sans-serif, with large, bold headings paired with smaller, readable body text. A subtle serif italic font is used sparingly for emphasis, adding a touch of elegance. The color palette centers on a deep forest green as the primary color, complemented by a warm brown and a soft lavender accent, all set against a very light neutral background. Black is used for primary text to ensure clarity and contrast. UI elements like buttons and forms are understated with thin borders and minimal styling, reinforcing the clean and sophisticated feel. Photography is natural and organic but excluded from the core palette, serving to enhance the brand's authentic and quality-driven personality. Overall, the design communicates a refined, approachable, and organic brand identity suitable for premium, artisanal, or natural product brands.",

Doctor features: dashboard with today’s schedule, patient list, ability to edit sessions, view feedback, notifications, reschedule sessions, add/update patients. Admin features: dashboard to manage hospital info, doctor list, appointments, assign doctors, generate patient IDs, manage schedules, and global data access. Core function: automate Panchakarma session scheduling, with manual adjustment by Doctor/Admin. Tech stack: Backend (Python Django or FastAPI), Database (PostgreSQL or MySQL), Frontend (React or HTML/CSS with Bootstrap/Tailwind), OTP verification, notifications, sidebar navigation for each role, calendar pickers, loading spinners, and clear visuals for dashboards. The platform should automate scheduling and support multi-role hospital management.",
